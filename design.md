# Design Requirements for VibeSafe App

## Overview
VibeSafe is a cybersecurity testing app targeting solo developers and small startups using vibe coding. The design must prioritize usability for users with no coding experience, delivering a clean, modern, and minimalistic interface with a unique edge to stand out.

## Core Design Principles
1. **User-Friendly for Non-Coders**  
   - Intuitive navigation and layouts that require no technical knowledge.  
   - Clear labels, tooltips, and minimal steps to run a test.  
   - Avoid jargon-heavy visuals or complex workflows.

2. **Clean Look**  
   - Ample white space to reduce clutter and enhance focus.  
   - Simple typography with high readability (e.g., sans-serif fonts).  
   - Consistent alignment and spacing for a polished feel.

3. **Minimalistic & Modern**  
   - Strip away unnecessary elements—focus on core functionality (e.g., test initiation, report display).  
   - Sleek, flat design with subtle shadows or gradients for depth.  
   - Modern aesthetic that feels fresh and approachable.

4. **Unique Differentiator**  
   - Incorporate a subtle "vibe" motif—e.g., wavy lines, soft glows, or a dynamic progress animation inspired by coding flow states.  
   - Avoid generic tech tropes (e.g., matrix code, neon grids) to carve a distinct identity.

## Color Palette
- **Maximum 4 Colors**:  
  - **Base**: Neutral background (e.g., soft white `#F9FAFB` or light gray `#E5E7EB`) for the app’s foundation.  
  - **Base for Content**: Slightly contrasting shade (e.g., mid-gray `#6B7280`) for text and UI elements.  
  - **Primary**: Bold accent (e.g., teal `#2DD4BF` or vibrant purple `#A855F7`) for buttons and highlights.  
  - **Primary Content**: Softer variant of primary (e.g., `#99F6E4` or `#D8B4FE`) for secondary actions or hover states.  
- Use colors sparingly—primary for CTAs and key interactions, base tones for everything else.

## Typography
- Single, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Poppins, or Roboto).  
- Max 3 weights: Light for body, Regular for emphasis, Bold for headings/CTAs.  
- Font sizes: 16px base for readability, scaling up for hierarchy (e.g., 24px headings).

## UI Components
- **Buttons**: Rounded edges, solid primary fill for CTAs (e.g., "Run Test"), outlined for secondary actions.  
- **Inputs**: Simple, bordered fields with subtle focus states (e.g., primary color outline).  
- **Reports**: Card-based layout with icons, short text snippets, and expandable fix suggestions.  
- **Progress Indicators**: Smooth, vibe-inspired animation (e.g., pulsing wave or flowing bar).

## Layout Guidelines
- **Single-Column Priority**: Stack elements vertically for simplicity on smaller screens.  
- **Max Width**: 800px for content containers to keep it digestible.  
- **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive, with touch-friendly tap targets (min 48px).  

## Deliverables
- High-fidelity mockups for:  
  - Homepage (test initiation screen).  
  - Test progress screen.  
  - Results/report page.  
- Style guide with color codes, typography specs, and component examples.

## Notes
- Keep it lightweight—avoid heavy animations or graphics that slow load times.  
- Test with non-technical users to ensure zero confusion.  
- Differentiator should feel organic, not tacked-on—tie it to the "vibe coding" ethos.
