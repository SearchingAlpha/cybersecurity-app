Basic Threats to Web Apps on the Internet
1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
What it is: Attackers inject malicious scripts into your app that run in users’ browsers.  

Impact: Steals user data (like logins), defaces your app, or redirects users to sketchy sites.  

Why it happens: Unfiltered user inputs—like forms or comments—aren’t properly checked.  

Example: A signup form lets someone paste a script that hijacks sessions.

2. SQL Injection
What it is: Hackers trick your app into running harmful database commands.  

Impact: They can steal, delete, or alter your data—like user info or app settings.  

Why it happens: Poorly secured database queries, often from default no-code setups.  

Example: A search bar lets someone type a command to dump your user list.

3. Broken Authentication
What it is: Weak login systems let attackers impersonate users or admins.  

Impact: Unauthorized access to accounts, sensitive data, or full app control.  

Why it happens: Simple passwords, no 2FA, or exposed session tokens.  

Example: A “forgot password” link leaks reset tokens in the URL.

4. Insecure APIs
What it is: Weak spots in connections to external services (like payment tools or plugins).  

Impact: Attackers exploit these to steal data or break functionality.  

Why it happens: Misconfigured or outdated APIs, common in no-code integrations.  

Example: An unprotected API key lets someone siphon your user data.

5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
What it is: Attackers trick logged-in users into sending unwanted requests to your app.  

Impact: Actions like account changes or purchases happen without consent.  

Why it happens: Missing anti-CSRF tokens or weak session management.  

Example: A fake “click here” link transfers money from a user’s account.

6. Security Misconfiguration
What it is: Default settings or unused features left exposed.  

Impact: Hackers use these gaps to access your app, server, or data.  

Why it happens: Not locking down permissions, leaving debug mode on, or outdated software.  

Example: A no-code platform’s admin page left open at yourapp.com/admin.

7. Data Exposure
What it is: Sensitive info (like passwords or API keys) isn’t hidden or encrypted.  

Impact: Leaked data leads to breaches, identity theft, or app takeover.  

Why it happens: Unencrypted storage or unsecured connections (no HTTPS).  

Example: User emails stored in plain text get exposed in a breach.

8. Denial of Service (DoS)
What it is: Attackers flood your app with traffic to crash it.  

Impact: Your app goes offline, frustrating users and killing trust.  

Why it happens: Limited server resources or no protection against traffic spikes.  

Example: Bots overwhelm your login page until it stops responding.
